1. on startup, open data window.

2. master node accept load file command, generate file list from configuration and send file distribution to slave node.
   Should consider algorithm for file distribution accounting for file size and replication. Kind of like knapsack problem.
3. slave node load file in the list
4. master node accumulate meta-data from slave node and broadcast the accumulated meta-data to all slave node. i.e. all broadcast.
5. When servicing client read, use random algorithm to select from replicating file location. As replication count is known on startup, we use a hash table(or map) to store <file name> <meta-datas> pairs, each <meta-datas> is an array storing all meta-data of <file name>. All arrays are allocated on serial memory location to get better locality.
6. Any need to create speperate threas? It's needed on startup.
